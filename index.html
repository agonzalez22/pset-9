    <p class = "para">The FitnessGram Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal bodeboop. A sing lap should be completed every time you hear this sound. ding Remember to run in a straight line and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark. Get ready!… Start.</p>

    <p class = "para"> Jeremiah Johnson made his way into the mountains<br>
      Bettin’ on forgettin’ all  the troubles that he knew<br>
      The trail was wide and narrow<br>
      And the eagle  or the sparrow<br>
      Showed the path he was to follow as they flew.<br>
      A  mountain man’s a lonely man<br>
      And he leaves a life behind<br>
      It ought to  have been different, but oftimes you will find,<br>
      That the story doesn’t  always go that way you had in mind.<br>
      Jeremiah’s story was that kind. . .<br>

      <p class = "para">You seem to be quite angry, one might even say triggered. It must not be that way. Take a seat. Have a glass of milk or anything the sort incase you happen to be lactose intollerant or vegan. Take a deep breath and calm your mind. Such stress can be quite harmful to your health otherwise. Makes you age faster, increases blood pressure, increases the likelyhood of experiencing an heart attack, generally gives you a bad mood... All really unnecessary and easily avoidable things. And I'm letting you know, I know how you feel. From time to time I also just want to let my emotions run freely, regardless of the potential consequences. We've all been there. But it's important to remember that sometimes it's just best to liberate oneself of your own emotions, to think clearly and achieve peace of mind. Afterall, that's what we all strive for: Inner peace. So I hope after reading this comment you'll feel better and I wish you a very nice day, kind stranger </p>
